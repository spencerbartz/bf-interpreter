# bf-interpreter
A web-based interpreter for the Brainfreeze programming language. OK Brainfreeze isn't the language's real name but come on guys, I'm trying to stay professional here. If you _really_ need to know the real (vulgar) name, check out the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).
